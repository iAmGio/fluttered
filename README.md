# Fluttered

Welcome to the _Fluttered_ repository, where I host sample mobile applications built with the Flutter 2 framework.

These apps are neither production-ready nor exclusively aesthetic: the idea is to have fully working samples, following different design patterns, that could be easily adapted to real applications.
In order to simulate real-world API calls, data from these samples is asynchronously gained featuring small time delays and loading animations.

## Running
After locally cloning the repository, running its code will launch a randomly picked app from those available.  
To launch a specific app, use `flutter run --dart-define="app=APPNAME"`

## Apps

An app that lets you build your daily diet and features tasty recipes.  
Screenshots coming soon.
